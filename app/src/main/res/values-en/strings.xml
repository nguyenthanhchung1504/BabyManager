         You can use a small mattress called a changing pad, which is a kind of mattress to lie on when changing diapers. They are very convenient because they can be placed on a flat surface with the right height so there is no need to bend over to change the baby diaper. When using this type of mattress, mother can put a lining pad on the mattress to ensure the mattress is always clean, cool.

  You can use a wet towel to rub under the baby"s navel before changing diapers. If your baby is depressed, he or she will urinate in the bladder. So you will prevent the urine on the mother when changing diapers.

 If the house has many floors, you need to prepare some diapers, creams, wipes and trash on each floor so that you do not have to go up and down several times.

  Mother should be prepared in advance for her baby. Never wait to run away to buy.

  You should not throw away the new diaper just because its paste is loose or sticky. Just use a personal patch or medical bandage as the back pad can be used normally.
